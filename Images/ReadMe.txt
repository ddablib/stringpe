This directory contains source files for the icons used on the property
editor's toolbar. They were all created in Paint.NET.

Each file is named according to the action to which they relate: the file name
is the same as the action name without the leading "act".

To modify the images use Paint.NET to edit then save as a .pdn file to preserve
layers. Next flatten the images and export as .bmp files. Do not save the
flattened image as a .pdn file. Finally replace the appropriate image in the
property editor's image list.

All these images are derived from originals taken from third party icon sets.
See README.md for licensing details.
